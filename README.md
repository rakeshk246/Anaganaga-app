## üöÄ About The Project

"Anaganagaa" (meaning "Once upon a time..." in Telugu) was born from the idea that learning should be an adventure, not a chore. Many complex topics in science and math can be intimidating for young learners. This application is our mission to solve that problem. 

We use the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Image Generation models to transform any topic‚Äîfrom photosynthesis to black holes‚Äîinto a simple, fun, and visually engaging story. By making learning magical, we hope to spark a lifelong love of discovery and knowledge in every child.
